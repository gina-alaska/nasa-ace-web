    %p
      Arctic Collaborative Environment Joint Capability Technology Demonstration (ACE JCTD) is a web-based, open-access, Arctic-focused, environmental research and decision support system that integrates remote sensing data with new and existing environmental models to provide monitoring, analysis, and visualization based on earth observation data and modeling.

      With an initial focus on the Arctic region, the ACE JCTD allows researchers, students, search-and-rescue operators, subsistence hunters, and other stakeholders to use the site's open-access data. The goal of the ACE JCTD is to enable local, regional, and international cooperation and coordination on long-term environmental planning and near-term actions in response to climatic and environmental changes occurring in the Arctic Region.
